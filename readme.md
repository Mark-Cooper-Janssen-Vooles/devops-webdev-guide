## Docker 
Docker is a way to containerise projects which reduces complexity and makes the development experience consistent accross the board regardless of the OS etc. 

80% of time in software projects is spent managing existing software, and only 20% on innovation. Docker reduces this maintenance time and allows us to innovate more.

## Docker 
Docker is a way to containerise projects which reduces complexity and makes the development experience consistent accross the board regardless of the OS etc. 

80% of time in software projects is spent managing existing software, and only 20% on innovation. Docker reduces this maintenance time and allows us to innovate more.

## Infrastructure as code: Terraform
Terraform is an extremely popular open source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that can be used with many different cloud and service provider APIs. Terraform focuses on an immutable approach to infrastructure, with a terraform state file center to tracking the status of your real world infrastructure.

## AWS
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most adopted cloud platform, offering many services from data centers globally. It has millions of customers - most tech companies would either use this or Azure. AWS can help to lower costs, become more agile, and innovate faster, and implement microservices.
